        Hello everyone! My name is Higor Rofino. I live in Jundiai-SP (Brazil)
        with my wife and my daughter, I am 25 year old and I work with Planning
        Analytic building dashboards and reporting data. I've been married for 2
        years and my daughter has 2 months! My favorite hobby is to play soccer.
        But I can't play for now because I injured my knee.. I'm excited to
        leanr more about HTML and CSS because I'm looking for a web developer
        opportunity in the future. I already have strong knowledge in SQL and
        Databases. I'm working in a company called 'C&A' as a Commercial
        Planning Analyst.
